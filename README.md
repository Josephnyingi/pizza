## Description
 The homemade pizza is produced in-house daily and is another reason why the pizza at Pizza Inn always tastes better. The Twisty Bread, the signature Wingz and the delicious Double Meal are additional value-for-money options that keep our satis?ed customers coming back time after time. These are the meals that have made our Terri?c Tuesday everyoneâ€™s favourite day of the week. When entertaining, a Hawaiian, a Regina, or a Peri Peri Chicken pizza from Pizza Inn is the obvious and perfect option to please crowds of all ages.
